# What are the best practices for naming folders on GitHub

Based on the search results, here are the best practices for naming folders on GitHub:

1. Use lowercase letters exclusively[^1][^2][^4]. This ensures consistency across different operating systems and avoids case-sensitivity issues.
2. Use hyphens (-) to separate words instead of spaces or underscores[^1][^2][^4]. For example, use "admin-boundaries" rather than "admin_boundaries" or "adminBoundaries".
3. Keep folder names short, concise, and descriptive[^3][^4]. Aim for one or two words that accurately represent the contents.
4. Avoid using special characters, punctuation marks, or symbols in folder names[^2]. Stick to letters, numbers, and hyphens.
5. For date-based folders, use the YYYY-MM-DD format[^2]. This follows the ISO 8601 standard and ensures proper chronological sorting.
6. Use plural forms for collection names to avoid ambiguity[^1]. For example, use "commit-files" instead of "commit-file".
7. Consider using specific keywords at the beginning of folder names to indicate their purpose, such as "src" for source files, "docs" for documentation, or "test" for automated tests[^4].
8. If version control is necessary within the folder structure, use "v1", "v2", etc., at the end of the folder name[^2].
9. For projects with multiple environments or art sets, use the asset type as the parent directory (e.g., "Trees/Jungle", "Trees/City")[^7].
10. Prefer a deeper folder structure over long folder names[^7]. This helps in organizing files more efficiently and makes it easier to navigate the repository.

By following these naming conventions, you'll create a more organized, consistent, and easily navigable GitHub repository structure.
