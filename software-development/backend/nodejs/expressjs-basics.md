## What is Express.js?

Express.js is a fast, minimalist, and unopinionated web framework for Node.js. It simplifies building server-side applications and APIs by providing essential features for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and more[^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] [^5].

## Key Features

- **Minimal and Flexible:** Provides only the essentials, allowing you to structure your app as you prefer and add features through middleware[^1] [^2] [^4].
- **Powerful Routing:** Supports defining routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and URLs, making it ideal for RESTful APIs[^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] [^7].
- **Middleware Support:** Lets you use and create middleware functions to handle tasks like authentication, logging, parsing, and error handling[^1] [^3] [^5] [^7].
- **Templating Engines:** Integrates with engines such as Pug, EJS, and Handlebars for rendering dynamic HTML pages[^1] [^3] [^4][^5].
- **Static File Serving:** Easily serves static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript from a folder[^4].
- **Error Handling:** Built-in and customizable error-handling mechanisms[^1] [^3] [^7].
- **Rich Ecosystem:** Large community and a vast collection of plugins and middleware for extending functionality[^1] [^5].

## How Express.js Works

1. **Handles HTTP Requests:** Listens for requests from clients (browsers, apps) using defined routes and methods (GET, POST, etc.)[^1].
2. **Route Matching:** Checks incoming requests against defined routes and processes matched requests accordingly[^1] [^2] [^3].
3. **Middleware Processing:** Passes requests through a stack of middleware functions for tasks like parsing, authentication, and logging[^1] [^3] [^5].
4. **Sends Response:** After processing, sends a response to the client (HTML, JSON, redirect, etc.)[^1].
5. **Error Handling:** Handles errors through custom middleware if needed[^1] [^3] [^7].

## Example: Basic Express.js Application

```

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Define a simple route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});

```

## Summary

Express.js is a lightweight and flexible framework that streamlines the process of building web applications and APIs in Node.js. Its minimalist design, powerful routing, middleware support, and active ecosystem make it a popular choice for scalable and maintainable server-side development[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5].
