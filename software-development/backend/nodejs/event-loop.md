# What is the Event Loop in Node.js and how does it work

The **Event Loop** in Node.js is the core mechanism that enables **asynchronous, non-blocking I/O** operations, allowing Node.js to handle many tasks concurrently on a single thread without blocking the execution of other code[^2][^4][^6].

### How the Event Loop Works

1. **Initialization**: When a Node.js application starts, it runs all the synchronous code first and registers asynchronous tasks (like timers, file I/O, or network requests)[^1][^4].
2. **Delegation to System APIs**: Asynchronous operations are offloaded to system APIs or a thread pool (via the `libuv` library), freeing up the main thread to continue executing other code[^4].
3. **Event Queues**: When these async tasks complete, their callbacks are placed in the **event queue** (or other specialized queues like the microtask queue)[^2][^5].
4. **Event Loop Phases**: The event loop continuously cycles through several phases, each handling a specific type of callback or event[^3] [^5]:
    - **Timers**: Executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`.
    - **I/O Callbacks**: Handles most I/O events, excluding close events, timers, and `setImmediate()`.
    - **Idle/Prepare**: Internal use.
    - **Poll**: Retrieves new I/O events and executes their callbacks.
    - **Check**: Executes callbacks scheduled by `setImmediate()`.
    - **Close Callbacks**: Handles closed connections and resources.
5. **Microtasks and Priorities**: Microtasks (such as those from Promises or `process.nextTick()`) are executed after each phase, before the event loop moves to the next phase. Microtasks have higher priority than regular callbacks[^2][^5].
6. **Repeat**: The event loop repeats these phases as long as there are tasks to process. The process exits when there is no more work left in the event loop[^3].

### Key Points

- **Single-threaded**: The event loop runs on a single thread, but Node.js can handle many concurrent operations by offloading heavy or blocking tasks to the system or a thread pool[^2] [^4].
- **Non-blocking**: While one task is waiting (e.g., for file I/O), Node.js can process other events, making it highly efficient for I/O-bound applications[^2] [^4].
- **CPU-bound tasks**: Heavy computation can block the event loop, so such tasks should be offloaded to worker threads or separate processes[^2].

**In summary:**
The event loop is what allows Node.js to efficiently handle multiple concurrent operations without multi-threading, by managing queues of events and executing their callbacks in a specific, predictable order[^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] [^5].
