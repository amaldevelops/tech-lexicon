## Flexbox guide

- `display:flex` : A flex container is any element that has display: flex on it. A flex item is any element that lives directly inside of a flex container. Somewhat confusingly, any element can be both a flex container and a flex item. Said another way, you can also put display: flex on a flex item and then use flexbox to arrange its children. Flex is actually a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis.
- [The Odin Project : Flex Growing and Shrinking](<(https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-growing-and-shrinking)>)
- `flex-grow` : Expects a single number as its value, and that number is used as the flex-item’s “growth factor”. When we applied flex: 1 to every div inside our container, we were telling every div to grow the same amount. The result of this is that every div ends up the exact same size. If we instead add flex: 2 to just one of the divs, then that div would grow to 2x the size of the others.
- `flex-shrink` : Similar to flex-grow, but sets the “shrink factor” of a flex item. flex-shrink only ends up being applied if the size of all flex items is larger than their parent container. For example, if our 3 divs from above had a width declaration like: width: 100px, and .flex-container was smaller than 300px, our divs would have to shrink to fit.
- `flex-basis` : Simply sets the initial size of a flex item, so any sort of flex-growing or flex-shrinking starts from that baseline size. The shorthand value defaults to flex-basis: 0%. The reason we had to change it to auto in the flex-shrink example is that with the basis set to 0, those items would ignore the item’s width, and everything would shrink evenly. Using auto as a flex-basis tells the item to check for a width declaration (width: 250px). Important Note About Flex-Basis: There is a difference between the default value of flex-basis and the way the flex shorthand defines it if no flex-basis is given. The actual default value for flex-basis is auto, but when you specify flex: 1 on an element, it interprets that as flex: 1 1 0. If you want to only adjust an item’s flex-grow you can simply do so directly, without the shorthand. Or you can be more verbose and use the full 3 value shorthand flex: 1 1 auto, which is also equivalent to using flex: auto.
- `flex: auto` : Is one of the shorthands of flex. When auto is defined as a flex keyword it is equivalent to the values of flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1 and flex-basis: auto or to flex: 1 1 auto using the flex shorthand. Note that flex: auto is not the default value when using the flex shorthand despite the name being “auto” which may be slightly confusing at first. You will encounter and learn more about flex: auto and its potential use-cases when reading through the assignment section. In Practice: You will likely not be using complex values for flex-grow, flex-shrink or flex-basis. Generally, you’re most likely to use declarations like flex: 1; to make divs grow evenly and flex-shrink: 0 to keep certain divs from shrinking. It is possible to get fancy, and set up layouts where some columns relate to each other in a specific ratio, so it’s useful to know that you can use other values, but those are relatively rare.
- `flex-direction:column` : column puts the main axis vertical (top-to-bottom).
- `flex-direction: row` : Puts the main axis horizontal (left-to-right), the flex-direction property's default is row.
- `justify-content: center` : Aligns items across the main axis vertically
- `align-items: center` : [The Odin Project : Alignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-alignment). Aligns items across the main axis horizontally
- `gap: 8px` : Setting gap on a flex container simply adds a specified space between flex items . As with all properties in CSS, some initial values are defined, so when creating a flex container all of the contained flex items will behave in the following way. Items display in a row (the flex-direction property's default is row). The items start from the start edge of the main axis. The items do not stretch on the main dimension, but can shrink. The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross axis. The flex-basis property is set to auto. The flex-wrap property is set to nowrap.
- `flex-wrap: no-wrap` : Using nowrap would cause an overflow if the items were not able to shrink, or could not shrink small enough to fit. It is also the initial value.
- `flex-wrap: wrap` : As flex-wrap is set to wrap, the items wrap
- `flex-flow` : You can combine the two properties flex-direction and flex-wrap into the - `flex-flow` shorthand. The first value specified is flex-direction and the second value is flex-wrap
