# Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript

A **closure** in JavaScript is created when a function is defined inside another function, allowing the inner function to access variables and parameters from its outer (enclosing) functionâ€”even after the outer function has finished executing[^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] [^7]. This happens because the inner function "remembers" its lexical environment, which includes all the variables that were in scope when it was created.

**Key points about closures:**

- **Access to Outer Variables:** The inner function can access and manipulate variables declared in the outer function, even after the outer function has returned[^1] [^3] [^4][^7].
- **Lexical Scoping:** Closures rely on lexical scoping, meaning the scope of variables is determined by their physical placement in the source code[^7].
- **Persistence of State:** Closures allow functions to maintain private state between calls, which is useful for data encapsulation and creating private variables[^3] [^4] [^5].
- **Common Use Cases:** Closures are widely used for event handling, callbacks, creating private members in objects, currying, and managing asynchronous code[^4] [^5] [^6].

**Example:**

```javascript
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    return count++;
  };
}

const counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 0
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```

In this example, the inner function returned by `makeCounter` forms a closure over the `count` variable. Even after `makeCounter` has finished executing, the returned function can still access and update `count` each time it's called[^3] [^4] [^7].

**Summary:**
A closure is the combination of a function and its surrounding lexical environment, enabling the function to access variables from its outer scope even after that scope has closed. This concept is fundamental to JavaScript and underpins many advanced patterns and features in the language[^1] [^3] [^4] [^7].
