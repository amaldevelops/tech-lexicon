# What are React Hooks and why were they introduced

**React Hooks** are special functions introduced in React 16.8 that allow developers to use **state**, **side effects**, and other React features directly within functional components, eliminating the need for class components[^1] [^2] [^5] [^6]. Before Hooks, only class components could manage state and lifecycle methods, while functional components were limited to rendering UI based on props and were often called "stateless" or "dumb" components[^2] [^3].

### Why were React Hooks introduced?

Hooks were introduced to solve several key problems[^2] [^5] [^7]:

- **State and Side Effects in Functional Components:** Previously, functional components could not manage state or handle side effects (like data fetching or subscriptions) directly. Developers had to convert them to class components for these features, leading to more boilerplate and less flexibility[^2] [^5].
- **Reusability of Logic:** Sharing stateful logic between components was difficult and often required patterns like higher-order components (HOCs) or render props, which could make code harder to read and maintain[^2] [^7].
- **Simpler, Cleaner Code:** Hooks allow developers to write components as plain functions, reducing the complexity and verbosity of class syntax and eliminating the need for the `this` keyword[^1] [^2] [^5].
- **Encapsulation and Testing:** Hooks make it easier to extract and reuse logic across components by creating custom hooks, improving code organization and testability[^1][^7].


### What do Hooks enable?

- **State management:** With `useState`, functional components can hold and update local state.
- **Side effects:** With `useEffect`, you can perform actions like fetching data or setting up subscriptions.
- **Context and more:** Hooks like `useContext`, `useReducer`, and custom hooks allow for advanced patterns and logic sharing[^1] [^2] [^5] [^9].

**In summary:**
React Hooks make functional components as powerful as class components by letting them manage state, handle side effects, and reuse logic, all with simpler and more maintainable code[^1] [^2] [^5] [^6].
