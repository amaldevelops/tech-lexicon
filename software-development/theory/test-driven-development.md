# Test Driven Development

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a software development methodology where **tests are written before any functional code** is implemented[^1] [^4] [^3]. The process is highly iterative and centers around the **Red-Green-Refactor cycle**:

- **Red:** Write a new test for the next bit of functionality. This test should fail initially, confirming that the feature isn't yet implemented[^5] [^2].
- **Green:** Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass. The focus here is on correctness, not optimization[^5] [^2].
- **Refactor:** Clean up the code for readability, maintainability, and efficiency, ensuring that all tests still pass after changes[^5] [^2].

This cycle is repeated for each new feature or change, ensuring that the codebase is always covered by relevant tests and remains clean and modular[^5] [^3].

## Key Principles

- **Tests drive development:** Developers only write new code when there is a failing test to satisfy, which helps prevent unnecessary or speculative code[^1] [^2].
- **Automated unit testing:** TDD relies on automated tests, typically at the unit level, to verify small, isolated pieces of functionality[^3] [^6].
- **Continuous feedback:** The process provides rapid feedback, catching bugs early and confirming that new code does not break existing functionality[^5] [^6].

### Benefits

- **Improved code quality:** By writing tests first, developers clarify requirements and ensure that all code is tested[^2] [^5].
- **Faster debugging:** Issues are caught early, making them easier and less expensive to fix[^5].
- **Enhanced maintainability:** Refactoring is safer and more frequent, leading to cleaner, more modular code[^5] [^2].
- **Supports Agile practices:** TDD fits naturally with Agile and continuous integration workflows, enabling rapid, reliable delivery[^4] [^5].

### Typical TDD Workflow

1. Write a failing test for a small piece of functionality (**Red**).
2. Write just enough code to make the test pass (**Green**).
3. Refactor the code, improving structure and removing duplication (**Refactor**).
4. Repeat for the next feature or change[^5] [^2] [^3].

TDD was popularized by **Kent Beck** as part of Extreme Programming (XP) and is now a widely adopted practice for building robust, maintainable, and well-tested software[^1] [^2] [^5].
