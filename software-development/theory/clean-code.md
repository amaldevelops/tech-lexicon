- Indentation : 2 spaces for indentation
- Semicolons: Always Add semicolons
- Line length:Break lines that are longer than about 80 characters.
- Break immediately after an operator or comma
- Indent continuation lines by one level
- Vertically align continuation lines with the first variable
- Naming Things:Names for functions and variables should be descriptive. Always use camelCase. To keep things consistent and easy to read, variables should always begin with a noun or an adjective (that is, a noun phrase) and functions with a verb. It is ok to use single characters as variable names in the context of a loop or a callback function, but not elsewhere.
- Revise Your Logic Before Coding
- Clearly Expose the Structure of the Page
- Write Explanatory Comments and Avoid Abusing Comments
- Avoid Extremely Large Functions
- Use Naming Standards for Functions and Variables: Whenever a variable or a function is created, its name should be descriptive enough as to give a general idea of what it does or what it’s for.
- Avoid Indiscriminate Mixing of Coding Languages
- Summarize Your Imports: Even though it is much better to have additional coding languages imported from different files, this shouldn’t be abused. If there are too many style sheets, they can probably be summarized into one or two. This won’t only save space and make things look cleaner, but it will also save loading time. Each imported file is an HTTP request that tampers with the performance of your application. So apart from being a consideration for tidiness, it is also a consideration for efficiency.
