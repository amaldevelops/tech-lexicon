# Software Engineering Basics

**Software engineering theories** are foundational concepts and principles that guide the design, development, and maintenance of high-quality software systems. These theories help ensure software is reliable, maintainable, scalable, and adaptable to changing requirements.

## Core Principles of Software Engineering

The most widely recognized theoretical foundations in software engineering include:

- **Modularity**: Divides software into independent, manageable modules. This enables parallel development, easier maintenance, and reusability[^1] [^2].
- **Abstraction**: Hides complex implementation details, exposing only what is necessary. This reduces complexity and enhances security and usability[^1] [^2].
- **Encapsulation**: Restricts direct access to an object’s internal state, requiring all interaction through defined interfaces. This protects data integrity and simplifies maintenance [^1].
- **Cohesion**: Measures how closely related the functions within a module are. High cohesion means a module focuses on a single task, improving maintainability and robustness [^1].
- **Coupling**: Refers to the degree of dependency between modules. Low coupling is preferred, as it makes systems more flexible and easier to modify [^1].

### SOLID Principles

For object-oriented design, the **SOLID** principles are a cornerstone:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class or module should have one reason to change—focus on a single responsibility[^3].
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification, promoting extensibility without altering existing code [^3].
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program [^5].
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Prefer many specific interfaces over a single general-purpose interface[^5].
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations[^5].

### Additional Theoretical Foundations

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each part of a program should address a separate concern, minimizing overlap and making the system easier to develop and maintain [^3].
- **Phased Life-Cycle Management**: Use a structured life-cycle plan (requirements, design, implementation, testing, maintenance) to manage complexity and ensure quality [^4].
- **Continuous Validation and Disciplined Control**: Regularly validate software against requirements and maintain strict control over changes to ensure reliability and traceability [^4].
- **KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Strive for simplicity in design and implementation, making systems easier to understand and maintain [^5].
- **Requirement Analysis**: Thoroughly analyze and understand user requirements to ensure the software delivers value and meets user needs [^5].

### Theoretical Models and Theorems

- **Fundamental Theorem of Software Engineering**: Suggests that "we can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection," emphasizing the power of abstraction and modularity [^6].
- **Seven Basic Principles (Boehm)**: Manage with a phased plan, perform continuous validation, maintain disciplined control, use modern practices, ensure accountability, use better people, and commit to process improvement[^4] [^7].
