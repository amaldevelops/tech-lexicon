# VS code basics

**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is a popular, free, and highly customizable code editor designed for fast, efficient development across many programming languages and frameworks. Here are the essential basics to get started:

### Main Interface Components

- **File Explorer**: View and manage files/folders in your workspace.
- **Search**: Find text across files (**View > Search** or `Ctrl+Shift+F`).
- **Source Control**: Integrate with Git or other version control systems (**View > Source Control** or `Ctrl+Shift+G`).
- **Run and Debug**: Run and debug your code with breakpoints and watch variables (**View > Run** or `Ctrl+Shift+D`).
- **Extensions**: Add language support, themes, and tools from the marketplace (**View > Extensions** or `Ctrl+Shift+X`)[^2].
- **Integrated Terminal**: Use a built-in command line (**View > Terminal** or ``Ctrl+```).
- **Command Palette**: Access all commands quickly (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)[^2].

### Basic Actions

- **Create a New File**: **File > New File** (`Ctrl+N`).
- **Save a File**: **File > Save** (`Ctrl+S`). Enable **Auto Save** if desired.
- **Open/Close Tabs**: Each file opens in a new tab. You can split the editor to view multiple files side by side[^3].
- **Customize Appearance**: Change color themes (**Theme > Color Theme** or `Ctrl+K Ctrl+T`), font size, and layout to your preference[^2][^3].

### Coding Features

- **IntelliSense**: Get smart code completions and suggestions as you type.
- **Code Actions**: Quick fixes and refactoring options.
- **Snippets**: Insert common code patterns quickly.
- **Emmet**: Write HTML/CSS faster with abbreviations[^3].
- **Debugging**: Set breakpoints and step through code for troubleshooting.

### Tips

- **Workspace Trust**: When opening a new folder, VS Code may ask if you trust the code. Only trust code you know is safe[^1].
- **Profiles**: Save and sync your settings, extensions, and keybindings across devices[^4].
