# VS code basics

**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is a popular, free, and highly customizable code editor designed for fast, efficient development across many programming languages and frameworks. Here are the essential basics to get started:

## Getting Started

- **Download \& Install**: Download VS Code from the official website and install it for your operating system[^2].
- **Opening a Project**:
  - Use **File > Open Folder...** to open a project directory (workspace). This lets you manage and edit multiple files and folders within your project[^1] [^2].
  - The **Explorer** view on the left shows your project structure[^1].

### Main Interface Components

- **File Explorer**: View and manage files/folders in your workspace.
- **Search**: Find text across files (**View > Search** or `Ctrl+Shift+F`).
- **Source Control**: Integrate with Git or other version control systems (**View > Source Control** or `Ctrl+Shift+G`).
- **Run and Debug**: Run and debug your code with breakpoints and watch variables (**View > Run** or `Ctrl+Shift+D`).
- **Extensions**: Add language support, themes, and tools from the marketplace (**View > Extensions** or `Ctrl+Shift+X`)[^2].
- **Integrated Terminal**: Use a built-in command line (**View > Terminal** or ``Ctrl+```).
- **Command Palette**: Access all commands quickly (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)[^2].

### Basic Actions

- **Create a New File**: **File > New File** (`Ctrl+N`).
- **Save a File**: **File > Save** (`Ctrl+S`). Enable **Auto Save** if desired.
- **Open/Close Tabs**: Each file opens in a new tab. You can split the editor to view multiple files side by side[^3].
- **Customize Appearance**: Change color themes (**Theme > Color Theme** or `Ctrl+K Ctrl+T`), font size, and layout to your preference[^2][^3].

### Coding Features

- **IntelliSense**: Get smart code completions and suggestions as you type.
- **Code Actions**: Quick fixes and refactoring options.
- **Snippets**: Insert common code patterns quickly.
- **Emmet**: Write HTML/CSS faster with abbreviations[^3].
- **Debugging**: Set breakpoints and step through code for troubleshooting.

### Extensions

- Install extensions for languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.), linters, formatters, and tools like Live Preview for web development[^2].
- Browse and manage extensions from the Extensions view[^2].

### Tips

- **Workspace Trust**: When opening a new folder, VS Code may ask if you trust the code. Only trust code you know is safe[^1].
- **Profiles**: Save and sync your settings, extensions, and keybindings across devices[^4].

VS Code is designed to be approachable for beginners but powerful enough for advanced development. As you get comfortable, explore its customization options, keyboard shortcuts, and productivity features to streamline your workflow[^1][^2][^3].
