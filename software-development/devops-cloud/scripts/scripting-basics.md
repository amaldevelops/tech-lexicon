# Scripting basics

**Scripting** refers to writing small programs (scripts) that automate tasks, manage infrastructure, or glue together complex workflows—especially in DevOps, cloud, and containerized environments. Scripting languages are essential for automation, configuration management, CI/CD, orchestration, and rapid prototyping.

## Most Popular Scripting Languages in DevOps \& Cloud

| Language               | Strengths \& Use Cases                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Python**             | Most popular for automation, infrastructure management, CI/CD, and cloud APIs. Readable, versatile, huge library ecosystem. Used for scripting, automation, and building tools for platforms like Kubernetes and AWS.[^1] [^2] |
| **Bash**               | Essential for Linux shell scripting, deployment scripts, and automation on Unix-based systems. Common in Docker image builds and CI/CD pipelines.[^1] [^2]                                                                     |
| **PowerShell**         | Key for automating Windows server tasks, configuration, and cloud management in Microsoft environments. Robust data manipulation and system administration features.[^1]                                                       |
| **Go (Golang)**        | Used for building high-performance DevOps tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform). Great for writing standalone binaries and Kubernetes operators. Strong concurrency support.[^1] [^2]                                          |
| **Groovy**             | Main language for Jenkins pipelines (CI/CD). Easy for Java developers, supports pipeline-as-code and shared libraries.[^1]                                                                                                     |
| **JavaScript/Node.js** | Used for backend scripting, building APIs, and infrastructure as code (e.g., Pulumi). Useful for integrating with web UIs and cloud services.[^1] [^2]                                                                         |

## Scripting in Containerization and Orchestration

- **Kubernetes:** Written in Go, but scripting with Python and Bash is common for automation, plugins, and cluster management.[^2]
- **Docker:** Uses Bash for build scripts and automation; Python and Go for utilities and plugins.
- **CI/CD:** Groovy (Jenkins), Python, Bash, and Node.js are used to automate build, test, and deployment pipelines.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Tools like Terraform (Go), Pulumi (supports JavaScript, TypeScript, Python), and Ansible (Python) rely heavily on scripting for automation.

## Why Scripting Matters

- **Automation:** Reduces manual work, increases speed, and minimizes errors.
- **Integration:** Bridges gaps between tools, APIs, and platforms.
- **Flexibility:** Quickly adapt to new requirements or environments.
- **Portability:** Scripts can be shared, versioned, and reused across teams and projects.

**In summary:**
Learning scripting—especially Python, Bash, and PowerShell—will make you highly effective in DevOps, cloud, and containerized environments. Go is crucial for building advanced tools and working with Kubernetes, while Groovy and JavaScript are valuable for CI/CD and infrastructure automation.[^1] [^2]
