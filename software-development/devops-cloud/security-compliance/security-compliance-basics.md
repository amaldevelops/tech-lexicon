# Security compliance basics

**Security compliance** in cloud-native and containerized environments means ensuring that your systems, processes, and data handling meet industry regulations (such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, and NIST 800-190) and internal security standards. Achieving compliance is not just about passing audits—it’s about building secure, resilient systems that protect sensitive data and minimize risk, especially as threats and regulatory requirements evolve[^2] [^4].

## Key Principles of Security Compliance

- **Governance \& Access Control:** Use **role-based access control (RBAC)** to tightly manage who can deploy, modify, or access workloads. Regularly audit permissions and enforce the principle of least privilege to reduce the risk of escalation or unauthorized access[^2] [^3] [^4].
- **Image \& Supply Chain Security:** Only use **trusted, signed base images** from verified sources. Continuously scan images and dependencies for vulnerabilities, and maintain a **software bill of materials (SBOM)** for every build to track components and ensure provenance[^1] [^2] [^3] [^4].
- **Automated Policy Enforcement:** Integrate compliance checks and security policies into your CI/CD pipelines. Block deployments that don’t meet required standards, and automate the enforcement of security configurations (e.g., Pod Security Standards in Kubernetes)[^2] [^3] [^4].
- **Secrets Management:** Never store secrets (API keys, passwords) in images or plain-text environment variables. Use dedicated secrets management tools and ensure secrets are handled securely throughout the pipeline[^3] [^4].
- **Network Segmentation \& Isolation:** Enforce **network segmentation** and container isolation to prevent lateral movement in case of compromise. Use namespaces, network policies, and service meshes for fine-grained control[^1] [^3] [^4].
- **Monitoring, Logging \& Auditing:** Centralize logging and continuously monitor for suspicious activity. Maintain detailed audit trails for all access and changes, which is essential for both incident response and compliance audits[^1] [^3] [^4].
- **Patch Management:** Regularly update container images, runtimes, and the underlying host OS with the latest security patches to address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited[^3] [^4].
- **Documentation \& Standardization:** Maintain clear documentation of security controls, policies, and procedures. Standardize deployment and configuration practices to ensure consistent compliance across all environments[^4].

## Regulatory Standards to Consider

- **PCI DSS 4.0:** Payment data security.
- **HIPAA:** Healthcare data protection.
- **GDPR:** European data privacy.
- **NIST 800-190:** Container security guidelines.
- **SBOM-based compliance:** Tracking all software components for transparency and risk management[^2].

## Best Practices for Compliance in 2025

- **Scan early and often:** Integrate vulnerability and compliance scanning at every stage of your CI/CD pipeline[^2] [^3] [^5].
- **Automate policy enforcement:** Use tools that automatically block non-compliant images or configurations before they reach production[^2] [^4].
- **Isolate workloads:** Use namespaces, cgroups, and kernel features to ensure strong isolation and limit blast radius[^4].
- **Maintain audit trails:** Enable and regularly review logs and audit records for all critical actions and access[^1] [^3] [^4].
- **Continuous compliance:** Treat compliance as an ongoing, automated process, not a one-time event[^2][^4].

**In summary:**
Modern security compliance is proactive, automated, and deeply integrated into the software development lifecycle. By combining governance, automation, monitoring, and best practices, organizations can meet regulatory requirements and build resilient, secure systems in cloud-native environments[^2] [^4].
