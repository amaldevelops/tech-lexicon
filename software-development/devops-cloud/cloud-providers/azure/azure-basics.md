# Azure basics

**Microsoft Azure** is a comprehensive cloud platform offering a vast range of services for building, deploying, and managing applications at global scale. Below is a detailed overview of Azureâ€™s capabilities, features, and recent advancements based on the latest available information.

## Core Azure Services \& Offerings

- **Compute:** Azure provides a wide variety of virtual machine (VM) sizes and types, supporting up to 96 virtual CPUs and 1,832 GB of memory per VM, with NVMe support and up to 400,000 IOPS for high-performance workloads. VM storage throughput can reach up to 11.4 GB/s, and performance can be dynamically adjusted, even while in use, with submillisecond latency for ultra disks[^1] [^4].
- **Storage:** Azure supports scalable, high-performance storage options, including Blob Storage, Data Lake Storage, and Ultra Disks, which allow dynamic changes to IOPS and throughput without downtime[^1] [^2].
- **Networking:** Services like Azure Front Door provide global layer 7 load balancing with Microsoft-managed wildcard certificates, anycast IPs, split TCP for faster connections, and high throughput for HTTP workloads[^1] [^2].
- **Databases:** Azure offers managed relational (SQL Database, PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (Cosmos DB), and in-memory databases, as well as specialized services like Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra and Azure Confidential Ledger for tamperproof data storage[^2].
- **AI \& Machine Learning:** Azure delivers end-to-end AI solutions with Azure Machine Learning, AI Custom Vision, Document Intelligence, and the Azure OpenAI Service. These tools enable experimentation, model management, and the deployment of advanced AI at scale[^2].
- **Analytics:** Azure Data Lake Storage and Azure Stream Analytics provide massive scalability and real-time analytics on fast-moving data streams[^2].
- **Containers \& Kubernetes:** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager support container orchestration and multi-cluster management for cloud-native applications[^2].
- **Internet of Things (IoT):** Azure IoT services connect, monitor, and control billions of IoT assets, offering continuous asset management and threat detection for both managed and unmanaged devices[^2].
- **Security \& Governance:** Azure includes advanced security posture management, intelligent threat protection, and continuous asset management for cloud, hybrid, and multicloud workloads[^2] [^5].


## Advanced \& Specialized Features

- **Frictionless Key Management:** You can now switch storage volumes from platform-managed keys to customer-managed keys without data migration, enhancing security and compliance with minimal disruption[^1].
- **Hybrid \& Edge Computing:** Azure Arc extends Azure management to on-premises, edge, and multicloud environments, providing unified operations, pay-as-you-go licensing, and integration with Windows Admin Center for streamlined management[^3].
- **AI Companion \& Automation:** Microsoft Copilot in Azure simplifies cloud operations and management, providing AI-driven recommendations and automation from cloud to edge[^2].
- **High-Performance Computing (HPC):** Azure supports HPC workloads with managed parallel file systems and high-throughput compute resources[^2].
- **Content Delivery \& Media:** Azure Front Door and CDN ensure secure, reliable, and globally distributed content delivery, with support for live and on-demand streaming at scale[^2].
- **Real-Time \& 3D Rendering:** Azure Remote Rendering enables high-quality, interactive 3D content streaming in real time[^2].
- **Security Innovations:** Azure Defender for IoT, cloud-native SIEM, and web application firewall (WAF) services provide advanced threat protection and compliance monitoring[^2].
- **Governance:** New governance tools released in 2025 enable greater agility and control over cloud environments, supporting both centralized and decentralized management models[^5].


## Latest Updates (2025)

- **VM Performance:** Introduction of Platinum processors, offering up to 50% CPU performance improvement over previous generations[^1].
- **Dynamic Storage \& Migration:** Ability to change IOPS and throughput on storage dynamically, and migrate encryption keys without data movement[^1].
- **Hybrid Management:** Enhanced Azure Arc setup, pay-as-you-go licensing, and integration with Windows Admin Center for unified management across all environments[^3].
- **AI Integration:** Deeper integration of AI and automation across management, security, and analytics services[^2] [^5].


## Use Cases

- **Enterprise Applications:** Scalable hosting for mission-critical workloads with high availability and disaster recovery.
- **AI \& Analytics:** End-to-end platforms for data science, machine learning, and real-time analytics.
- **IoT \& Edge:** Secure, scalable solutions for connecting and managing IoT devices and edge computing.
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Seamless integration of on-premises, multicloud, and edge resources for flexible deployment.

**Azure** continues to evolve rapidly, with a focus on performance, security, hybrid capabilities, AI integration, and governance, making it a leading choice for organizations seeking innovation and scalability in the cloud[^1] [^2] [^3] [^5].
