# Cloud basics

**Cloud computing** is the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet, rather than relying on local servers or personal devices[^1][^5][^9]. This model enables users and organizations to access scalable and flexible resources on-demand, typically with pay-as-you-go pricing[^2][^6].

## Key Concepts and Components

- **On-Demand Self-Service:** Users can automatically provision computing resources as needed, without requiring human interaction with the service provider[^3].
- **Broad Network Access:** Services are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, using various devices like laptops, tablets, or smartphones[^1] [^3].
- **Resource Pooling:** Providers pool resources to serve multiple users, dynamically assigning and reallocating resources based on demand. This is typically managed through virtualization technologies[^1][^3].
- **Elasticity:** Resources can be scaled up or down quickly to match workload demands, allowing organizations to efficiently manage costs and capacity[^2] [^3].
- **Measured Service:** Usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer, and enabling pay-per-use billing models[^2] [^6].


## Core Service Models

| Model | Description | Example Use Cases |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| IaaS | **Infrastructure as a Service:** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. | Virtual machines, storage |
| PaaS | **Platform as a Service:** Offers platforms for developing, testing, and deploying software. | App hosting, development tools |
| SaaS | **Software as a Service:** Delivers software applications via the internet. | Email, CRM, collaboration |

## Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud:** Services offered over the public internet and shared across multiple organizations.
- **Private Cloud:** Dedicated infrastructure operated solely for one organization.
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them for greater flexibility[^1] [^3].
- **Multi-Cloud:** Use of multiple cloud services from different providers for redundancy or specialized capabilities[^1].


## Fundamental Building Blocks

- **Compute:** Processing power provided by virtual machines or containers[^4].
- **Storage:** Scalable data storage solutions, such as object storage or databases[^1][^4].
- **Networking:** Connectivity between cloud resources and users, including security measures like firewalls and encryption[^1][^4].
- **Security:** Data protection, identity management, and compliance with regulations are integral to cloud operations[^1][^2].


## Benefits

- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces the need for large upfront investments in hardware and infrastructure.
- **Scalability:** Easily adjusts resources to meet changing demands.
- **Accessibility:** Enables remote work and global collaboration.
- **Reliability:** Offers disaster recovery, backup, and high availability features[^1] [^2].

Cloud computing has become essential for modern organizations, enabling innovation, agility, and efficient resource management[^1][^2] [^3].
