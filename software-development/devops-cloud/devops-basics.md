# Devops basics

**DevOps** is a modern software development methodology that unifies **development (Dev)** and **IT operations (Ops)** to accelerate the delivery of high-quality applications and services. It is both a set of practices and a cultural philosophy aimed at breaking down traditional silos between development, operations, quality assurance, and security teams, fostering greater collaboration and shared responsibility throughout the software lifecycle[^1] [^2] [^5].

## Core Principles of DevOps

- **Collaboration:** DevOps encourages close cooperation and communication between all stakeholders—developers, operations, QA, and security—so teams can build, test, deploy, and iterate on software more efficiently and reliably[^1][^3][^6].
- **Automation:** Key processes such as building, testing, deploying, and monitoring are automated to reduce manual work, minimize errors, and speed up delivery[^3] [^4].
- **Continuous Integration \& Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** Small, frequent code changes are automatically integrated, tested, and deployed, allowing for rapid feedback and faster releases[^2] [^3].
- **Continuous Improvement:** Teams regularly review and refine their processes, tools, and workflows to increase efficiency, reduce waste, and better meet user needs[^3] [^4].
- **Short Feedback Loops:** Fast, iterative feedback helps teams quickly identify and resolve issues, improving product quality and user satisfaction[^3] [^4].


## DevOps Lifecycle Phases

- **Plan:** Define features, requirements, and workflows (tools: Jira, Confluence).
- **Build:** Code, compile, and package software (tools: GitHub, Jenkins, Docker).
- **Test:** Automated and manual testing to ensure quality (tools: various automated testing frameworks).
- **Deploy:** Release software to production environments (tools: Jenkins, Kubernetes).
- **Operate:** Monitor and manage applications in production (tools: DataDog, New Relic).
- **Observe:** Collect metrics and feedback to inform future improvements (tools: AppDynamics, Dynatrace)[^4].


## Benefits of DevOps

- **Faster time to market** for new features and bug fixes.
- **Improved product quality** and reliability.
- **Greater operational efficiency** and reduced downtime.
- **Enhanced ability to respond to customer needs and market changes**[^5].

DevOps is fundamentally about unifying people, processes, and technology to deliver better products, faster, and with greater reliability[^2] [^5].
