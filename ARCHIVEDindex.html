              <strong>Given-When-Then (GWT):</strong> Is a semi-structured way
              to write down test cases. They can either be tested manually or
              automated as browser tests with tools like Selenium and Cucumber.
              It derives its name from the three clauses used, which start with
              the words given, when and then.Given describes the preconditions
              and initial state before the start of a test and allows for any
              pre-test setup that may occur. When describes actions taken by a
              user during a test. Then describes the outcome resulting from
              actions taken in the when clause. The Given-When-Then was proposed
              by Dan North in 2006, as part of behavior-driven development.

            <li>
              <strong>Arrange-Act-Assert:</strong>
              A pattern for arranging and formatting code in UnitTest methods:
              Each method should group these functional sections, separated by
              blank lines:Arrange all necessary preconditions and inputs. Act on
              the object or method under test.Assert that the expected results
              have occurred.

              <ul>
                <li>Indentation:2 spaces for indentation</li>
                <li>Semicolons: Always Add semicolons</li>
                <li>
                  Line length:Break lines that are longer than about 80
                  characters.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Break immediately after an operator or comma</li>
                    <li>Indent continuation lines by one level</li>
                    <li>
                      Vertically align continuation lines with the first
                      variable
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Naming Things:Names for functions and variables should be
                  descriptive. Always use camelCase. To keep things consistent
                  and easy to read, variables should always begin with a noun or
                  an adjective (that is, a noun phrase) and functions with a
                  verb. It is ok to use single characters as variable names in
                  the context of a loop or a callback function, but not
                  elsewhere.
                </li>
                <li>Revise Your Logic Before Coding</li>
                <li>Clearly Expose the Structure of the Page</li>
                <li>Write Explanatory Comments and Avoid Abusing Comments</li>
                <li>Avoid Extremely Large Functions</li>
                <li>
                  Use Naming Standards for Functions and Variables: Whenever a
                  variable or a function is created, its name should be
                  descriptive enough as to give a general idea of what it does
                  or what it’s for.
                </li>
                <li>Avoid Indiscriminate Mixing of Coding Languages</li>
                <li>
                  Summarize Your Imports: Even though it is much better to have
                  additional coding languages imported from different files,
                  this shouldn’t be abused. If there are too many style sheets,
                  they can probably be summarized into one or two. This won’t
                  only save space and make things look cleaner, but it will also
                  save loading time. Each imported file is an HTTP request that
                  tampers with the performance of your application. So apart
                  from being a consideration for tidiness, it is also a
                  consideration for efficiency.

              display:flex; : A flex container is any element that has display:
              flex on it. A flex item is any element that lives directly inside
              of a flex container. Somewhat confusingly, any element can be both
              a flex container and a flex item. Said another way, you can also
              put display: flex on a flex item and then use flexbox to arrange
              its children. Flex is actually a shorthand for flex-grow,
              flex-shrink and flex-basis.
              (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-growing-and-shrinking)
            </li>

            <li>
              flex-grow : Expects a single number as its value, and that number
              is used as the flex-item’s “growth factor”. When we applied flex:
              1 to every div inside our container, we were telling every div to
              grow the same amount. The result of this is that every div ends up
              the exact same size. If we instead add flex: 2 to just one of the
              divs, then that div would grow to 2x the size of the others.
            </li>

            <li>
              flex-shrink : Similar to flex-grow, but sets the “shrink factor”
              of a flex item. flex-shrink only ends up being applied if the size
              of all flex items is larger than their parent container. For
              example, if our 3 divs from above had a width declaration like:
              width: 100px, and .flex-container was smaller than 300px, our divs
              would have to shrink to fit.
            </li>

            <li>
              flex-basis : Simply sets the initial size of a flex item, so any
              sort of flex-growing or flex-shrinking starts from that baseline
              size. The shorthand value defaults to flex-basis: 0%. The reason
              we had to change it to auto in the flex-shrink example is that
              with the basis set to 0, those items would ignore the item’s
              width, and everything would shrink evenly. Using auto as a
              flex-basis tells the item to check for a width declaration (width:
              250px). Important Note About Flex-Basis: There is a difference
              between the default value of flex-basis and the way the flex
              shorthand defines it if no flex-basis is given. The actual default
              value for flex-basis is auto, but when you specify flex: 1 on an
              element, it interprets that as flex: 1 1 0. If you want to only
              adjust an item’s flex-grow you can simply do so directly, without
              the shorthand. Or you can be more verbose and use the full 3 value
              shorthand flex: 1 1 auto, which is also equivalent to using flex:
              auto.
            </li>

            <li>
              flex: auto; : Is one of the shorthands of flex. When auto is
              defined as a flex keyword it is equivalent to the values of
              flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1 and flex-basis: auto or to flex: 1 1
              auto using the flex shorthand. Note that flex: auto is not the
              default value when using the flex shorthand despite the name being
              “auto” which may be slightly confusing at first. You will
              encounter and learn more about flex: auto and its potential
              use-cases when reading through the assignment section. In
              Practice: You will likely not be using complex values for
              flex-grow, flex-shrink or flex-basis. Generally, you’re most
              likely to use declarations like flex: 1; to make divs grow evenly
              and flex-shrink: 0 to keep certain divs from shrinking. It is
              possible to get fancy, and set up layouts where some columns
              relate to each other in a specific ratio, so it’s useful to know
              that you can use other values, but those are relatively rare.
            </li>

            <li>
              flex-direction:column; : column puts the main axis vertical
              (top-to-bottom).
            </li>

            <li>
              flex-direction: row; : Puts the main axis horizontal
              (left-to-right), the flex-direction property's default is row.
            </li>

            <li>
              justify-content: center; : Aligns items across the main axis
              vertically
            </li>

            <li>
              align-items: center; : Aligns items across the main axis
              horizontally
            </li>

            <li>
              gap: 8px; : Setting gap on a flex container simply adds a
              specified space between flex items
              (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-alignment)
            </li>

            <li>
              As with all properties in CSS, some initial values are defined, so
              when creating a flex container all of the contained flex items
              will behave in the following way. Items display in a row (the
              flex-direction property's default is row). The items start from
              the start edge of the main axis. The items do not stretch on the
              main dimension, but can shrink. The items will stretch to fill the
              size of the cross axis. The flex-basis property is set to auto.
              The flex-wrap property is set to nowrap.
            </li>

            <li>
              flex-wrap: no-wrap; : Using nowrap would cause an overflow if the
              items were not able to shrink, or could not shrink small enough to
              fit. It is also the initial value.
            </li>
            <li>
              flex-wrap: wrap; : As flex-wrap is set to wrap, the items wrap
            </li>

            <li>
              flex-flow : You can combine the two properties flex-direction and
              flex-wrap into the flex-flow shorthand. The first value specified
              is flex-direction and the second value is flex-wrap
            </li>
          </ul>

                  <code>npm create vite@latest . -- --template react</code>
                  This will tell Vite to use the current directory for the
                  project, instead of creating a new directory with the given
                  project name. This cloned directory should already be
                  initialized as a git repo and connected to the right remote
                  i.e use standard github repo creation process.

          <h3>Python Basics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Python Indentation: Indentation refers to the spaces at the
              beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the
              indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in
              Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a
              block of code.
            </li>
            <li>
              # : Add in front of the code for commenting out single line of
              code
              <br />
              """ <br />
              Use triple quotes for multiline comments <br />
              """
            </li>

            <li>print("Hello World"): Print a message onto the screen</li>

            <li>
              Variable: Variables store data types into the memory of your
              computer, Variable names are case-sensitive. allowing Python to
              automatically populate them into your code when you reference them
              later.<br />
              "Name=Value" <br />
              On the left side of the variable we give name for the variable =
              On the right side we assign a value <br />
              A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more
              descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). <br />
              Rules for Python variables:<br />
              A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore
              character<br />
              A variable name cannot start with a number<br />
              A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and
              underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )<br />
              Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three
              different variables)<br />
              Pascal Case: Each word starts with a capital letter:
              MyVariableName = "John" <br />
              Snake Case: Each word is separated by an underscore character:
              my_variable_name = "John"
            </li>

            <li>
              Primitive Data Types: Data types that are single objects and are
              immutable (cannot be changed without being redefined). These are:
              <ul>
                <li>Numbers: Numbers (with an optional + or - prefix).</li>
                <li>
                  Integers: are whole numbers with an optional positive + or
                  negative - prefix. For example, 3, 82, 38218, +3, -71 are all
                  integers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Floats: Any number containing a decimal point is interpreted
                  as a float (e.g., 0.32, .32, 83.7823, 1.00).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Strings: Sequences of characters, always enclosed in quotation
                  marks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Booleans: Also called flags; these can only be True or False.
                </li>
                <li>None: Represents a null value, or the absence of data.</li>
                <li>
                  Numerical Operators: programmers perform equations with data
                  by using numerical operators, which include +, -, *, /, //,
                  and %.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              Converting Data Types: we use built-in functions like float(),
              int(), str() to convert a data type. For instance, say our data
              set stores the number “1” as a string. To convert it to an
              integer, we would write int('1')
            </li>

            <li>
              Casting : If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this
              can be done with casting.<br />
              x = str(3) # x will be '3' <br />
              y = int(3) # y will be 3 <br />
              z = float(3) # z will be 3.0
            </li>

            <li>
              Get the Type : You can get the data type of a variable with the
              type() function i.e. <br />
              x = 5 <br />
              y = "John"<br />
              print(type(x)) <br />
              print(type(y) <br />

              Lists: Enclosed by square brackets ([]). Mutable (changeable)
              collections of objects with specific orders. The objects in a list
              can be any combination of data types and do not have to be unique
              (elements can be repeated).

            <li>
              Dictionaries: Also enclosed by curly braces, but elements are
              pairs joined by a colon ({:}). These are sets of key-value pairs.
              Every element has a key (of any immutable data type), which must
              be unique, and a value (which can be of any data type and does not
              need to be unique — multiple keys can have the same value).
              Dictionaries, like sets, are unordered — their index is the keys,
              not a list of numbers.

          <h3>Python: Functions</h3>
          <p>
            A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You
            can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can
            return data as a result.

          <h3>Python: Classes/Objects</h3>
          <p>
            Python is an object oriented programming language. Almost everything
            in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A Class is
            like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

          <p>
            Create a Class To create a class, use the keyword class:<br />

            Example Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:
            <br />

            class MyClass:<br />
            x = 5

          <h3>Python: Data structures definition and usage</h3>
          <h3>Python: Collections (Arrays)</h3>
          <p>
            There are four collection data types in the Python programming
            language: List is a collection which is ordered and changeable.
            Allows duplicate members. Lists are used to store multiple items in
            a single variable. Create a List: thislist = ["apple", "banana",
            "cherry"] print(thislist)
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
            </li>
            <li>
              List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second
              item has index [1] etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ordered: When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the
              items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at
              the end of the list.
            </li>
            <li>
              Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but
              in general: the order of the items will not change.
            </li>
            <li>
              Changeable: The list is changeable, meaning that we can change,
              add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
            </li>
            <li>
              Allow Duplicates: Since lists are indexed, lists can have items
              with the same value:
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Python: Tuples</h3>
          <p>
            Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows
            duplicate members. Tuples are used to store multiple items in a
            single variable. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and
            unchangeable. Tuples are written with round brackets. Create a
            Tuple: thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") print(thistuple)
            tuple Items
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second
              item has index [1] etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ordered: When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the
              items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unchangeable: Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot
              change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
            </li>
            <li>
              Allow Duplicates: Since tuples are indexed, they can have items
              with the same value:
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Python: Set</h3>
          <p>
            Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and
            unindexed. No duplicate members. Sets are used to store multiple
            items in a single variable. A set is a collection which is
            unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. * Note: Set items are
            unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items. Sets are
            written with curly brackets. Example Create a Set: thisset =
            {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} print(thisset)
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Set Items: Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow
              duplicate values.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unordered: Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a
              defined order.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them,
              and cannot be referred to by index or key.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unchangeable: Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot
              change the items after the set has been created.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can
              remove items and add new items.
            </li>
            <li>
              Duplicates Not Allowed: Sets cannot have two items with the same
              value. No duplicate members.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Python: Dictionary</h3>
          <p>
            Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable.
            Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A
            dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not
            allow duplicates. Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and
            have keys and values: Example Create and print a dictionary:
            thisdict = { "brand": "Ford", "model": "Mustang", "year": 1964 }
            print(thisdict)
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Dictionary Items: Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and
              does not allow duplicates. Dictionary items are presented in
              key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name. v
            </li>
            <li>
              Ordered or Unordered? :As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are
              ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
              When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items
              have a defined order, and that order will not change. Unordered
              means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot
              refer to an item by using an index.
            </li>
            <li>
              Changeable: Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can
              change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.
            </li>
            <li>
              Duplicates Not Allowed: Dictionaries cannot have two items with
              the same key:
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Python: Jupyter Notebook</h3>

              Replace by c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir =
              '/the/path/to/home/folder/' Make sure you use forward slashes in
              your path and use /home/user/ instead of ~/ for your home
              directory, backslashes could be used if placed in double quotes
              even if folder name contains spaces as such : "D:\yourUserName\Any
              Folder\More Folders\"
            </li>

                  <code>screen -s [name] , screen -r [name]</code>: This tool
                  allows you to let something run in the background even if you
                  close your session. `-s` option to start a new screen with the
                  following name. `-r` option to resume a running screen with
                  this name. You can forget the name if you want, an ID will be
                  generated, use screen `-r` to find it and screen `-r [ID]` to
                  resume it. With only one screen running, screen `-r` will
                  resume it directly.

              <h3>Git: Essentials</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>git status </code>: command gives us all the necessary
                  information about the current branch.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>git add</code> : We need to use the git add command to
                  include the changes of a file(s) into our next commit.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      To add a single file:
                      <code>git add [filename] </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      To add all files in repo at once:
                      <code>git add -A </code>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code> git commit</code>: is like setting a checkpoint in the
                  development process which you can go back to later if needed.
                  We also need to write a short message to explain what we have
                  developed or changed in the source code.
                  <p><code>git commit -m "commit message"</code></p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>git push</code> :After committing your changes, the next
                  thing you want to do is send your changes to the remote
                  server. Git push uploads your commits to the remote
                  repository.
                  <p><code>git push [remote][branch-name]</code></p>
                  <p>
                    However, if your branch is newly created, then you also need
                    to upload the branch with the following command:<br />
                    <code
                      >git push --set-upstream [remote]
                      [name-of-your-branch]</code
                    >
                    <br />
                    alternatively you can also use:
                    <code>git push -u origin [branch_name]</code>
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>git pull</code> : command is used to get updates from
                  the remote repo. This command is a combination of git fetch
                  and git merge which means that, when we use git pull, it gets
                  the updates from remote repository (git fetch) and immediately
                  applies the latest changes in your local (git merge).<br />
                  <code>git pull [remote]</code>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>git log -- oneline</code> : To see our commit history
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>.gitignore : </strong>
                  Git can specify which files or parts of your project should be
                  ignored by Git using a .gitignore file. Step 1: touch
                  .gitignore Step 2: # text comment | name All name files, name
                  folders, and files and folders in any name folder | name/
                  Ending with / specifies the pattern is for a folder. Matches
                  all files and folders in any name folder For more information
                  go to :

                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>git revert</code> : A safer way that we can undo our
                  commits is by using git revert. We just need to specify the
                  hash code next to our commit that we would like to undo:<br />
                  <code>git revert 3321844</code><br />
                  The Git revert command will undo the given commit, but will
                  create a new commit without deleting the older one: The
                  advantage of using git revert is that it doesn't touch the
                  commit history. This means that you can still see all of the
                  commits in your history, even the reverted ones. Another
                  safety measure here is that everything happens in our local
                  system unless we push them to the remote repo. That's why git
                  revert is safer to use and is the preferred way to undo our
                  commits.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>git pull origin main</code> : Update local copy with the
                  remote copy
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>git fetch</code> : Use git fetch to retrieve new work
                  done by other people. Fetching from a repository grabs all the
                  new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those
                  changes into your own branches.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>git diff</code> : Show you all of your local changes
                  since you last committed.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>git diff index.html</code> : To check what changes made
                  to a certain file simply add the path of a file as an option
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>git diff --color-words index.html</code> : this option
                  shows a more concise view
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>git diff --staged index.html</code> : Staged changes in
                  a certain file
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>git diff --staged</code> : Staged changes in all local
                  files
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>git diff main (NAME OF OTHER BRANCH)</code> : It's also
                  possible to compare two branches to each other. This helps you
                  find out how exactly the code in both branches is different:
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>git diff main feature/login index.html</code> : Compare
                  a certain file in two different branches. You can do this
                  simply by adding the file's path: This will show you how the
                  file "index.html" was changed in the feature/login branch,
                  compared to how it looks in the main branch.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>git remote update origin --prune</code> : To update the
                  local list of remote branches
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code> git branch -a</code> : To show all local and remote
                  branches that (local) Git knows about
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>git checkout dev</code> : When you've completed
                  development in your branch and everything works fine, the
                  final step is merging the branch with the parent branch (dev
                  or master). This is done with the git merge command. Git merge
                  basically integrates your feature branch with all of its
                  commits back to the dev (or master) branch. It's important to
                  remember that you first need to be on the specific branch that
                  you want to merge with your feature branch. For example, when
                  you want to merge your feature branch into the dev branch.
                  First you should switch to the dev branch:
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code> git fetch</code> : Before merging, you should update
                  your local dev branch
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>git merge [branch-name]</code> : Finally, you can merge
                  your feature branch into dev
                </li>

                  <strong>Git clone</strong> : is a command for downloading
                  existing source code from a remote repository (like Github,
                  for example). Git clone basically makes an identical copy of
                  the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it
                  to your computer. There are a couple of ways to download the
                  source code,

                    <code>git checkout -b [new-branch-name]</code>. If you want
                    to push the new branch to the remote repository, use
                    <code>git push -u origin [new-branch-name]</code>. To switch
                    back to the main branch or any other branch, run git
                    checkout main (or the branch name you wish to switch

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Make a new branch and change to it with the command
                    <code>`git checkout -b [branch name]`</code>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Push this new branch to your remote repo with the command
                    <code>`git push origin [branch name]`</code>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You can check current branch, with the
                    <code>`git branch`</code> command. The branch you are
                    currently on will have an (*)asterisk next to it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Now you’re all set to work on your new feature! Note: You
                    can add files, commit to this branch, and push changes to
                    your repo, just like you would with the main branch.
                    Everything is the same except when you push the changes,
                    you’d use
                    <code>`git push origin [New Branch Name]`</code>
                    instead of <code>git push origin main</code>, since we’re
                    pushing to our new branch.

                    To merge the changes from our New branch back to our main
                    branch; Checkout the branch we want to merge INTO i.e. main
                    with the command git checkout main. Now let’s merge our [new
                    branch] into [`main`], our current branch, with
                    <code>git merge [new branch]</code>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If everything goes fine, new branch is now successfully
                    merged with main! Use
                    <code>git log</code> and you’ll see all the commits you’ve
                    made to your new branch on top of the commits you made to
                    the main branch.

                  <li>

                    <code>git push origin main</code>.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Go to your GitHub repo and you’ll see that our main branch
                    will have all the changes and commits you made to the [new
                    branch] Now that we have all our code in the main branch, we
                    don’t really need our [new branch] branch anymore. Let’s do
                    some cleanup, both locally and in the remote repo.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Delete the branch from our local repo with
                    <code>git branch -d [new branch name]</code> and also delete
                    it from the remote repo on GitHub with <code></code>git push
                    origin --delete [new branch name]
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <li>
                  <strong>GitHub Pages:</strong>

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Remove the 'dist' directory from the project’s .gitignore
                      file.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Make sure git knows about your subtree (the subfolder with
                      your site)
                      <code
                        >git add dist && git commit -m "Initial dist subtree
                        commit"</code
                      >
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Use subtree push to send it to the gh-pages branch on
                      GitHub.

                      <code
                        >git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages</code
                      >
                      Boom. If your folder isn’t called dist, then you’ll need
                      to change that in each of the commands above.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      By adding this to the packages.json, you can simply push
                      the commit to both the main branch and the gh-pages branch
                      (Git Hub pages will be served from gh-pages branch)
                      <code
                        >"scripts": {"gh-pages": "git subtree push --prefix dist

                    First register a project as a local Git repository the first
                    thing you need to do is perform the following command at
                    your project root: <code>git init</code>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Above will create a .git folder at your project root and
                    will allow you to start using Git in that repository.You can
                    call origin whatever you like, really, but origin is the
                    standard name for Git remote repositories.
                    [Repository_Location] is the URL to your remote repository.
                    For example, if I had a new project called
                    reactResumeCVWebApp which I want
                    <code
                      >`git remote add origin
                      git@github.com:1Amal/reactResumeCVWebApp.git`</code
                    >
                    Then
                    <code>`git push --set-upstream origin main`</code> to set
                    the default upstream branch
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Then <code>git pull</code> to download the github repo to
                    local folder <code>`git pull origin main`</code> Most of the
                    time you will get an error as you have different files on
                    Github (initial repository files such as .gitignore) and

          <h3>The 7 layers of the OSI model</h3>

              <b>A</b>ll <b>P</b>eople <b>S</b>eem <b>T</b>o <b>N</b>eed
              <b>D</b>ata <b>P</b>rocessing : The first letter of each word is
              the same as the first letter an OSI layer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Layer 7 - Application:</b>
              The Application Layer in the OSI model is the layer that is the
              “closest to the end user”. It receives information directly from
              users and displays incoming data to the user. Oddly enough,
              applications themselves do not reside at the application layer.
              Instead the layer facilitates communication through lower layers
              in order to establish connections with applications at the other
              end. Web browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) TelNet,
              and FTP, are examples of communications that rely on Layer 7.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b> Layer 6 - Presentation: </b> The Presentation Layer represents
              the area that is independent of data representation at the
              application layer. In general, it represents the preparation or
              translation of application format to network format, or from
              network formatting to application format. In other words, the
              layer “presents” data for the application or the network. A good
              example of this is encryption and decryption of data for secure
              transmission; this happens at Layer 6.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Layer 5 - Session: </b>When two computers or other networked
              devices need to speak with one another, a session needs to be
              created, and this is done at the Session Layer. Functions at this
              layer involve setup, coordination (how long should a system wait
              for a response, for example) and termination between the
              applications at each end of the session.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Layer 4 – Transport: </b>The Transport Layer deals with the
              coordination of the data transfer between end systems and hosts.
              How much data to send, at what rate, where it goes, etc. The best
              known example of the Transport Layer is the Transmission Control
              Protocol (TCP), which is built on top of the Internet Protocol
              (IP), commonly known as TCP/IP. TCP and UDP port numbers work at
              Layer 4, while IP addresses work at Layer 3, the Network Layer.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Layer 3 - Network : </b>Here at the Network Layer is where
              you’ll find most of the router functionality that most networking
              professionals care about and love. In its most basic sense, this
              layer is responsible for packet forwarding, including routing
              through different routers. You might know that your Boston
              computer wants to connect to a server in California, but there are
              millions of different paths to take. Routers at this layer help do
              this efficiently.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Layer 2 – Data Link: </b>The Data Link Layer provides
              node-to-node data transfer (between two directly connected nodes),
              and also handles error correction from the physical layer. Two
              sublayers exist here as well--the Media Access Control (MAC) layer
              and the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer. In the networking world,
              most switches operate at Layer 2. But it’s not that simple. Some
              switches also operate at Layer 3 in order to support virtual LANs
              that may span more than one switch subnet, which requires routing
              capabilities.

              <b>Layer 1 - Physical: </b>At the bottom of our OSI model we have
              the Physical Layer, which represents the electrical and physical
              representation of the system. This can include everything from the
              cable type, radio frequency link (as in a Wi-Fi network), as well
              as the layout of pins, voltages, and other physical requirements.
              When a networking problem occurs, many networking pros go right to
              the physical layer to check that all of the cables are properly
              connected and that the power plug hasn’t been pulled from the
              router, switch or computer, for example.
