# Raspberry Pi basics

**Raspberry Pi** is a compact, affordable computer designed for education, experimentation, and a wide range of DIY projects. It’s widely used by beginners and professionals for learning programming, electronics, and building everything from simple gadgets to advanced systems.

- **What is it?**
  A single-board computer that runs Linux-based operating systems (typically Raspberry Pi OS). It connects to monitors, keyboards, and other peripherals like a regular computer[^2] [^4] [^6].
- **Models:**
  Ranges from the tiny Raspberry Pi Zero to the powerful Raspberry Pi 5. Each model varies in processing power, ports, and capabilities[^2].
- **Setup:**
  - You need a Raspberry Pi board, microSD card (with the OS), power supply, and optionally a keyboard, mouse, and monitor[^2][^4][^8].
  - You can use it as a desktop computer or set it up “headless” (no monitor/keyboard, accessed remotely over the network)[^2].
- **First Steps:**
  - Flash the OS onto the microSD card.
  - Plug in peripherals (monitor, keyboard, mouse) and power up[^2] [^4].
  - Complete the setup wizard: configure user, Wi-Fi, and update the software[^2].
  - Learn basic command-line skills (mkdir, ls, cd, rm, mv, nano)[^1].
- **Programming:**
  Comes pre-installed with Python and supports languages like Scratch, JavaScript, and more[^4].
- **GPIO Pins:**
  General Purpose Input/Output pins let you connect and control electronics (LEDs, sensors, motors, etc.) directly from your code[^3][^4].

## Advanced Raspberry Pi Information

- **Headless Operation:**
  Configure and access your Pi over SSH or VNC without a monitor—ideal for servers, IoT, and remote projects[^2].
- **Project Possibilities:**
  - Home automation, media centers, retro gaming consoles, personal web servers, VPNs, robotics, and more[^1] [^3] [^6] [^8].
  - Extensive community resources and tutorials available for all experience levels[^1] [^6] [^7].
- **Hardware Expansion:**
  - Attach HATs (Hardware Attached on Top) for extra features (e.g., motor controllers, sensors, displays).
  - Use the GPIO pins for advanced electronics projects, including automation and robotics[^3].
- **Performance \& Models:**
  - Newer models (like Raspberry Pi 5) offer significantly more power, USB 3.0, faster networking, and better graphics.
  - Power supply requirements vary—ensure you use the recommended voltage/current for your model to avoid issues[^2].
- **Operating Systems:**
  - Raspberry Pi OS is most common, but you can install Ubuntu, specialized media center OSes, or even lightweight server OSes[^2][^4].
- **Security:**
  - Change default passwords, keep your system updated, and use secure remote access methods[^2].
- **Learning Resources:**
  - Official guides and books (like the Official Raspberry Pi Beginner’s Guide) provide step-by-step instructions for both basic and advanced uses[^4] [^9].
  - Online project repositories and tutorials offer inspiration and practical guidance[^1] [^6].

**In summary:** Raspberry Pi is a versatile platform for learning and creating, from simple programming exercises to complex electronics and network projects. Start with basic setup and programming, then explore advanced applications as you grow more comfortable with the hardware and software[^2] [^4] [^6].
