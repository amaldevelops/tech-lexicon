# Ubuntu creating desktop link - Appimage example

Yes! If you want your **AppImage to appear in your Ubuntu application menu** (like a regular installed app), you can **create a desktop entry** manually. Here's how to do it:

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Add AppImage to Application Menu

### 1. **Move the AppImage to a permanent location**

Choose a directory where you’ll keep the AppImage, such as:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/linux-software
mv ~/Downloads/YourApp.AppImage ~/linux-software/
chmod +x ~/linux-software/YourApp.AppImage
```

#### 2. **Create a `.desktop` file**

This file tells the system how to launch your AppImage and display it in the menu.

Create the file:

```bash
nano ~/.local/share/linux-software/yourapp.desktop
```

Paste the following into the file (edit as needed):

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Your App Name
Exec=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/linux-software/YourApp.AppImage
Icon=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/linux-software/yourapp-icon.png
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;
Comment=Your app description here
Terminal=false
```

> 🔁 Replace:
>
> - `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username
> - `YourApp.AppImage` with your AppImage filename
> - `yourapp-icon.png` with the path to an icon (if available)

#### 3. **Make the desktop file executable**

```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/yourapp.desktop
```

#### 4. **Refresh your application menu**

You can now search for your app in the **Activities menu** or **application launcher**.

### 🧠 Tip: Where to get an icon?

- Some AppImages extract icons when run.
- You can also download a `.png` or `.svg` icon from the developer's website or GitHub.

### ✅ Done!

Your AppImage now behaves like a native app — it appears in the Ubuntu application menu and can be pinned to the dock.
