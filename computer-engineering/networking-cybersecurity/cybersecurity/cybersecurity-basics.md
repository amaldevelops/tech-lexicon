# Cybersecurity basics

**Cybersecurity theory** provides the foundational principles and models that guide the protection of digital systems and information against unauthorized access, attacks, and failures. At its core, cybersecurity theory blends technical, mathematical, and organizational concepts to ensure the security and resilience of computer systems.

## Core Theoretical Foundations

**1. The CIA Triad**
The most fundamental model in cybersecurity is the **CIA triad**:

- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive information. Techniques include encryption and access controls[^1] [^3].
- **Integrity:** Protecting data from unauthorized modification or destruction, maintaining its accuracy and trustworthiness[^1] [^3].
- **Availability:** Guaranteeing that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed, defending against disruptions like denial-of-service attacks[^1] [^3].

**2. Key Theoretical Domains**

- **Cryptography:** The science of securing information through mathematical transformations, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication[^2] [^4].
- **Formal Methods:** Mathematical approaches to specify, develop, and verify security properties of systems, often using logic and proofs to guarantee correctness[^2].
- **Access Control Theory:** Models (like Discretionary, Mandatory, and Role-Based Access Control) that define how permissions and rights are granted, managed, and enforced[^2] [^4].
- **Security Protocols:** Formalized methods for secure communication and data exchange, including authentication, key exchange, and secure channel establishment[^2] [^4].

**3. Finite State Machines (FSMs) in Security**
FSMs model the behavior of systems as a series of discrete states and transitions. In cybersecurity, FSMs are used to:

- Analyze and design security protocols, ensuring all possible states and transitions are secure.
- Model access control systems, defining how rights and privileges change over time.
- Verify hardware and cryptographic systems for vulnerabilities and secure state transitions[^2].

### Additional Cybersecurity Concepts

- **Authentication \& Identification:** Mechanisms to verify user or system identities, including passwords, multi-factor authentication, and digital certificates[^4].
- **Vulnerability \& Threat Modeling:** Systematic identification and analysis of potential weaknesses and attack vectors[^1] [^3].
- **Incident Response \& Risk Management:** Frameworks for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents, and for assessing and mitigating risks[^1] [^3] [^4].
- **Security Standards \& Legal Frameworks:** Guidelines and regulations (such as ISO/IEC 27001, GDPR) that inform how organizations implement and manage security and privacy policies[^4] [^5].

### Summary Table

| Theory/Model       | Purpose/Function                                                                  |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CIA Triad          | Foundation for defining security goals (confidentiality, integrity, availability) |
| Cryptography       | Securing data via mathematical techniques                                         |
| Formal Methods     | Rigorous system specification and verification                                    |
| Access Control     | Managing permissions and user rights                                              |
| Security Protocols | Safe communication and transactions                                               |
| FSMs               | Modeling and verifying secure system behavior                                     |

**In essence:** Cybersecurity theory is built on the CIA triad, robust mathematical and logical models (cryptography, FSMs, formal methods), and practical frameworks for access control, authentication, and risk management. These foundations enable the design, implementation, and assurance of secure systems in an increasingly complex digital world[^1][^2][^3][^4].
