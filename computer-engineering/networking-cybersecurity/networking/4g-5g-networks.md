**Technical Innovations**

- **5G NR (New Radio):** New radio access technology standard, replacing LTE for higher efficiency and flexibility[^6].
- **mmWave Spectrum:** Utilizes high-frequency bands (30–300 GHz) for ultra-high speeds and capacity, in addition to low/mid bands for coverage[^7] [^6].
- **Massive MIMO:** Employs dozens or hundreds of antennas for greater capacity and spectral efficiency[^7].
- **Beamforming:** Directs signals precisely to devices, improving speed and reliability[^7].
- **Small Cells:** Dense deployment of low-power base stations to improve coverage and reduce latency, especially in urban areas[^7] [^8].
- **Edge Computing:** Processes data closer to users, reducing latency and enabling real-time applications[^7].
- **Standalone (SA) and Non-Standalone (NSA) Architectures:** NSA combines 5G radios with 4G core; SA uses a dedicated 5G core for full feature set and performance[^6].

**Emerging Capabilities with 5G-Advanced**

- Integration of AI/ML for network optimization.
- Enhanced support for XR (extended reality), autonomous vehicles, and critical IoT.
- Improved geolocation and time synchronization independent of satellite systems[^10].

**Typical Use Cases**
