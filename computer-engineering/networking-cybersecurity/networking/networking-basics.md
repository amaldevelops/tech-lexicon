# Networking basics

**Network engineering** is the discipline focused on designing, implementing, and managing computer networks that enable devices to communicate and share resources. It encompasses both the foundational technologies and the advanced protocols that power modern digital communication.

## Core Components and Concepts

- **Switches:** Central to network infrastructure, switches connect devices within a local network (such as computers, printers, and servers) and manage data traffic efficiently. There are on-premises switches (physical, locally managed) and cloud-managed switches (remotely managed, scalable)[^1] [^2].
- **Routers:** Routers link multiple networks together and connect devices to the internet. They analyze data packets, determine optimal routing paths, and can prioritize traffic. Routers are crucial for both home and enterprise networks, with enterprise routers offering advanced features like robust security and traffic management[^1] [^2].
- **Wireless Access Points (WAPs):** These enable wireless devices to join a wired network, extending connectivity and supporting mobility. WAPs are essential for modern offices and environments with many mobile devices[^1] [^2].
- **Ethernet (Cabling):** Ethernet cables physically connect devices, providing reliable, high-speed data transfer. While wireless is common, Ethernet remains vital for performance-critical applications[^1].
- **Firewalls:** Both hardware and software firewalls protect networks by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic, forming a key part of cybersecurity defenses[^1].
- **IP Addressing:** Every device on a network has an IP address, which acts like a digital address for sending and receiving data. There are public (internet-facing) and private (internal) IP addresses[^1].
- **Client-Server Model:** The client requests data or services, while the server provides them. This model underpins most web and enterprise applications[^1].
- **Bandwidth:** This measures the rate of data transfer (bits per second) across a network path, affecting network speed and performance[^1].

### Network Models and Protocols

- **OSI Model:** A conceptual framework with seven layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application) that standardizes network functions and interoperability[^4] [^5].
- **TCP/IP Model:** The practical protocol suite for the internet, focusing on reliable data transmission and routing[^4][^5].
- **Key Protocols:** IP, TCP, UDP, DNS, and TLS are fundamental for data delivery, addressing, name resolution, and security[^5].

### Network Types and Topologies

- **LAN (Local Area Network):** Connects devices within a limited area, like an office or building[^4].
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Spans larger geographic areas, connecting multiple LANs[^4].
- **Topologies:** Common layouts include star, mesh, and bus, each with different performance and reliability characteristics[^3].

### Advanced Topics

- **Routing:** Understanding static vs. dynamic routing, routing protocols, and how routers determine data paths is crucial for scalable network design[^5].
- **Network Security:** Beyond firewalls, includes intrusion detection, encryption (TLS), and secure network architecture[^5].
- **Performance Analysis:** Tools like Wireshark and TCPDUMP help diagnose and optimize network traffic[^5].
- **Virtualization:** Technologies like VLANs and Docker networking allow logical segmentation and flexible resource allocation[^5].

**Network engineering** is foundational for IT infrastructure, cloud computing, and backend development. Mastery involves both the physical aspects (hardware, cabling) and logical aspects (protocols, addressing, security) of network design and operation[^1] [^2][^4] [^5].
