# Mobile networks generations

Here is a concise technical comparison of **1G through 6G** mobile network generations:

| Generation | Technology Type          | Max Speed                  | Key Features \& Innovations                        | Typical Use Cases                       |
| :--------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **1G**     | Analog                   | 2.4 Kbps                   | Analog voice calls only, no data, poor security    | Basic mobile voice calls                |
| **2G**     | Digital (GSM, CDMA)      | 14.4–217.6 Kbps            | Digital voice, SMS, MMS, basic data (GPRS, EDGE)   | Voice, SMS, limited mobile internet     |
| **3G**     | Digital (UMTS, CDMA2000) | 384 Kbps – 336 Mbps        | Mobile internet, video calls, app ecosystem        | Web browsing, video calls, early apps   |
| **4G**     | Digital (LTE)            | 100 Mbps – 1 Gbps          | HD video, VoIP, fast data, low latency             | Streaming, gaming, cloud apps           |
| **5G**     | Digital (NR)             | 2–20 Gbps                  | Ultra-low latency, massive IoT, VR/AR, automation  | Smart cities, IoT, autonomous vehicles  |
| **6G**     | Digital + AI             | Up to 1 Tbps (theoretical) | Real-time holography, AI integration, global reach | Holographic comms, AI-driven automation |

## Technical Differences by Generation

- **1G:** Analog radio, only voice, highly insecure, low capacity, no data[^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] [^5] [^8] [^9].
- **2G:** Digital transmission, improved voice quality, added SMS/MMS, basic data via GPRS/EDGE, better security[^1] [^2] [^4].
- **3G:** Higher data rates, enabled mobile internet, video calls, and app stores; key for smartphone adoption[^1] [^2] [^3].
- **4G:** All-IP network, very high speeds, low latency, supports HD streaming, VoLTE (voice over LTE)[^1] [^2] [^3].
- **5G:** Massive bandwidth, ultra-low latency (as low as 1 ms), supports IoT at scale, VR/AR, autonomous systems[^1] [^2] [^3] [^6].
- **6G:** (Expected) Up to 1 Tbps, AI-native network management, real-time holography, global coverage (including remote areas), ultra-reliable and intelligent connectivity[^2] [^3] [^6] [^7].

### Summary of Key Innovations

- **1G:** Analog voice only.
- **2G:** Digital voice, text messaging.
- **3G:** Mobile broadband, multimedia, apps.
- **4G:** Fast internet, HD streaming, all-IP services.
- **5G:** Ultra-fast, low latency, IoT, immersive tech.
- **6G:** AI-driven, holographic, global, ultra-high speed.

**6G** is still in development, but is expected to revolutionize connectivity with speeds up to 1 Tbps, real-time AI integration, and support for applications like holographic communications and advanced automation[^2] [^3] [^6] [^7].
